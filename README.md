# 👋 Hi, I’m John Grier

I’m a data science graduate student at Illinois Tech focused on **Bayesian modeling**, **natural language processing**, and **finance**. I build systems that connect statistical reasoning to real-world problems — from streaming reception to portfolio strategy and generative model interpretation.

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🎬 [Streaming Sentiment Tracker](https://github.com/J-Grier/streaming-sentiment-tracker)
LSTM-based model tracks viewer sentiment across Reddit and YouTube in response to show releases. Incorporates topic modeling (LDA) and short-form text classification to monitor engagement and emotional tone.

> 🧠 LSTM | 💬 Reddit/YouTube APIs | 🔍 NLP pipelines | 📊 Fan sentiment analysis

---

### 🎞️ [Predicting TV Episode Reception with Bayesian Neural Networks](https://github.com/J-Grier/streaming-reception-bnn)
Uses Reddit discussions to predict IMDb episode ratings using a Bayesian Neural Network across 10+ shows including *Severance*, *Daredevil: Born Again*, *Bluey*, and *One Piece*. Integrates latent topic distributions (via LDA) and sentiment scores (via VADER) to forecast reception.

> 📈 Bayesian Neural Networks | 💬 Topic + sentiment fusion | 🎭 Episode-level modeling | 🧠 Uncertainty estimation

---

### 📈 [Quantitative Stock Portfolio Models](https://github.com/J-Grier/quantitative-stock-models)
Compares regression, clustering, and Bayesian inference models for selecting outperforming stocks relative to the S&P 500. Includes volatility filters, signal-based strategies, and performance evaluation.

> 📊 Clustering & regression | 🧮 Bayesian inference | 📉 Market simulation | 🔬 SPY comparison

---

### 🧠 [Bayesian NCAA Tournament Simulator](#)
(Coming soon) — A Bayesian Neural Network trained on historical college basketball data to forecast tournament matchups. Models uncertainty across team performance, seeding, and variability in outcomes.

> 📘 Pyro BNN | 🏀 Tournament prediction | 🔁 Posterior sampling | ⚖️ Class imbalance modeling

---

### 🌍 [Data-Driven CAGE Strategy Advisor](#)
(Ongoing) — A decision support tool that quantifies international expansion opportunities using the CAGE framework (Cultural, Administrative, Geographic, Economic). Combines structured global datasets with an interactive Streamlit dashboard for market entry simulation.

> 🌐 CAGE modeling | 📊 World Bank & Hofstede data | 🧩 Strategic scoring | 🧠 Streamlit interface
